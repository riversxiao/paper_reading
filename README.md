## paper_reading
------

I have to admit this is the part that frighted me most, I have never recieved any previous training in reading papers, but I've gain some insight on how to read a paper either from Machine Learning Meetup or from fastai course. 

I take this as an forever ongoing project

> **note** : I notice something, if I take it as an forever ongoing project, I will never read any paper, so I'm setting some goals for myself.

> there are some papers or blogs that are entertaining as well as thought provoking, so I decided to translate them into Chinese solid my understanding. 

README.md will be constantly updated
